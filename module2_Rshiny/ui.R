While the equation is simple, that doesn't mean that the process is easy. Reducing body fat means making changes in all areas of your life, not just in the way you eat and exercise.

Reducing body fat should not be a goal for everyone. If you fall into the essential fat or even the athlete category, you may need to consider gaining weight. Speak with your healthcare professional before making a decision.

It's also important to know that these numbers don't apply to pregnant women â€” you should not try to lose weight during pregnancy.

You'll also want to talk to your healthcare provider if you are trying to lose weight while on medications or during cancer treatment to make sure that it is safe to do so.

If your doctor determines that reducing your body fat percentage is a safe and beneficial health goal, here are some areas for you to consider making changes.", h4("Your Diet"),"How much you eat and what you eat is a huge factor in losing or gaining body fat. You might be tempted to try a popular diet, but fad diets generally don't work. What does work is making small changes, such as:

Reducing your portion sizes.
Eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day and avoiding the urge to skip breakfast.
Ensuring your diet contains lots of fruits and vegetables to fill you up and give you the nutrients you need.
Adding more fiber to your diet, which fills you up and makes it less likely you'll reach for less healthy snacks throughout the day.
Avoid sugary drinks and junk food.
Limit how much alcohol you drink.")

Its primary purpose is to store lipids from which the body creates energy.     In addition, it secretes a number of important hormones, and provides the body with some cushioning as well as insulation.

Body fat includes essential body fat and storage body fat.      Essential body fat is a base level of fat that is found in most parts of the body.      It is necessary fat that maintains life and reproductive functions.        The amount of essential fat differs between men and women, and is typically around 2-5% in men, and 10-13% in women.       The healthy range of body fat for men is typically defined as 8-19%, while the healthy range for women is 21-33%. While having excess body fat can have many detrimental effects on a person's health, insufficient body fat can have negative health effects of its own, and maintaining a body fat percentage below, or even at the essential body fat percentage range is a topic that should be discussed with a medical professional.

    Storage fat is fat that accumulates in adipose tissue, be it subcutaneous fat (deep under the dermis and wrapped around vital organs) or visceral fat (fat located inside the abdominal cavity, between organs), and references to body fat typically refer to this type of fat. While some storage fat is ideal, excess amounts of storage fat can have serious negative health implications.

    Excess body fat leads to the condition of being overweight and eventually to obesity given that insufficient measures are taken to curb increasing body fat. Note that being overweight does not necessarily indicate an excess of body fat. A person's body weight is comprised of multiple factors including (but not limited to) body fat, muscle, bone density, and water content. Thus, highly muscular people are often classified as overweight.

    The rate at which body fat accumulates is different from person to person and is dependent on many factors including genetic factors as well as behavioral factors such as lack of exercise and excessive food intake. Due to varying factors, it can be more difficult for certain people to reduce body fat stored in the abdominal region. However, managing diet and exercise has been shown to reduce stored fat. Note that both women and men store body fat differently and that this can change over time. After the age of 40 (or after menopause in some cases for women), reduced sexual hormones can lead to excess body fat around the stomach in men, or around the buttocks and thighs of women.")),
